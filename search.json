There are two events that led to this document being created.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n F2F Roundtables in Chicago\n\n\n\n~60 leaders from 40+ companies met F2F in Chicago for a series of discussions on the most pressing topics for late-stage reporting in R.\nThe discussion was crowdsourced via a github discussion, and led to the following topics:\n\nWhat are our goals for a modern clinical reporting workflow, on a modern SCE?\nWhat are the risks with our increasing external business code dependencies?\nWe have a path to R package validation - but what are we doing with shiny apps?\nWhat is the path to an interactive CSR?\nThe case for contributing to OS\nWhere are we with our people?\nWhat should we be doing to leverage advances in LLMs/AA/AI impact? (at the drug development through to developer efficiency levels)\nWhat are the barriers bringing imaging/genomics/digital biomarkers and the CRF closer?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n References\n\n\n\nPromotional site for round-tables\nR Validation Hub update\nDoug’s slides on the shared validated repo\nCAMIS - comparing differences based on tool used",

We don’t know what the ideal is today, but we know we need to be able to evolve and adapt to new technologies and approaches much more than we did in the past.\nHomegrown usually means modular, as still relient on different open soruce and vendor solutions (e.g. AWS, Hashicorp, etc). Is a more accurate description turnkey vs modular?\nHow to ensure our modular platform scales is an important new aspect, especially using new open source tools.\nIn a turnkey, the vendor will have baked in provenance. In a modular we must focus on making sure metadata/provenance runs as a background across the system to ensure we can trace back from an insights and transformations to the source data.\nA major pain point is how things are funded - we are not used to funding a platform for sustained evolution/innovation, but in the data science space things are constantly evolving - so moving to operations/maintenance is equilivant to decay.\n\n\n3.1.1 Relationship with informatics partners\n\nThere is often tension between informatics and the business, with the growth of business written code that looks more like software (e.g. R packages) vs the the scripts/macros we use to make. We shared experiences finding a balance as we entered this new phase.\nIt was refreshing to see we have cases where informatics and the business are aligned on one goal, and we need to be more proactive trying to create these relationships (including inviting informatics to our pan-industry discussions. J&J + Roche had informatics representation at this meeting, but otherwise the dialogue was from the business perspective).",

E.g. clinical reporting is low compute, while design and biomarker work is often heavy in memory and data.\n\n\nIs data part of the SCE? Traditionally yes, but some but not all companies are de-coupling data from compute.\nWhether it’s in the SCE or not, tracebility is extra important in our domain of regulatory reporting.\nIt appeared across all companies access to an SCE is through a web-browser (not a local application)",

How to build a modern SCE that doesn’t?\n\n\nDo we enable legacy workflows to work in the new SCE? 2) Only new ways, or 3) how do we find a balance to ensure business continuity while enabling innovation?\n\nThe human and process change management piece is massive, and SCE POs must work in tandem with statistical programming leadership.\nAgreement the biggest pain point is the dependency on file-based network share drives for data and insight outputs. One company mentioned they have millions of directories in their legacy SCE.\n\nMost companies have carried over having the outputs server be a network share drive, but would a more ‘publishing’ type model be more robust?",

    "text": "Chairs: Matthew Kumar and Cassie Burns\n\n4 Question\nWhere are we on getting data analysts and data scientists that work with clinical data on board (in particular, those delivering CSRs and submission packages)? What are the challenges - what has been overcome?\n\n\n5 Who are our people?\nPrefaced both sessions by asking individuals to define the our in our people;\n\nStat Programmers\nStatisticians\nData Management\nOther CSR-deliverable oriented roles (e.g. medical and scientific writing)\nManagement, Leadership\n\nTheme: R Adoption and Challenges\n\nThe adoption of R requires varied types of commitment depending on the perspective of the stakeholders involved, notably management and employees.\nLeadership usually supports the adoption of R, yet, in many cases, they don’t adequately communicate or advocate its application. Common concerns include the lack of realized ROI and the perception of R as a “nice-to-have” rather than a necessity.\nIt is not viable to mandate or compel individuals to learn R.\nSeasoned programmers, who prefer proprietary software, may leave the company if forced to switch.\nThese programmers often prefer to maintain current workflows that involve proprietary tools, established macros, homegrown IDEs, etc.\nSome in management endorse an approach of “mandate” or “force,” while others aim to “encourage.”\nExperienced stat programmers cite R’s learning curve as an obstacle to transition, and some don’t see the ROI in making the switch.\n\nTheme: Change Management\n\nImplementing proper change management was emphasized by several attendees in both sessions.\nOrganically, through change management, approximately 25% of experienced statistical programmers or statisticians have successfully completed R training, while the remaining 75% have shown resistance.\nAmong the successful 25%, only 5% have applied what they’ve learned in actual study work. This is often due to time constraints related to product deliverables.\nMapping the transition to R with learning and development goals is one strategy.\nA structured learning plan and a roadmap for R upskilling are essential. This includes trainings focused on R, particularly in the context of the pharmaceutical industry, and from a proprietary software programmer’s perspective.\nIdentification of champions or early adopters among statistical programmers could aid in transitioning colleagues.\nSeveral companies shared their strategies for promoting community learning (e.g., bi-monthly meetings, presentations, assignments), both on a “just in time” basis and on a regular schedule.\nPointing individuals to ongoing efforts and resources, such as R in Pharma, PharmaVerse, Phuse, etc., can boost awareness and participation.\nGranting individuals protected or dedicated time to learn and fail is recommended. An analogy used was “giving them a safe sandbox to try making a castle.”\nR need not be used for all tasks immediately. A more measured approach, such as starting with creating figures and then moving to more complex tasks, like AdAM programming, could better build confidence and competence.\nEnsuring enough transition time and clear direction (“as of X date, we’ll work in R”) is crucial.\nHaving leadership advocacy is vital at the end of the day.\n\n\n\n6 Theme: Emerging Talent\n\nNewer talent is increasingly trained in open-source approaches and languages, with fewer exposed to proprietary tools.\nWith the rise of data science as a field of study, many are less interested in joining a company for routine implementation work; they identify as “data scientists” and have been trained in markedly different ways.\nThis affects talent attraction, development, and retention within a company.\nInnovation can come from new hires, justifying the need to foster their development and listen to their insights.\nThere’s a unique opportunity for co-mentorship: new hires (proficient in R, Python, etc.) and existing staff (experts in domain knowledge, clinical trials, etc.): how vs what/why\nThere’s a need for clear “career pathing” or “trajectories” within statistical programming as roles evolve. Examples include:\n\n “Analyst” requires traditional statistical programming knowledge and training\n“Engineer” needs DevOps skills and a systems mindset\n“Tool builder” needs a software engineering mindset\n\nGeneral trends suggest companies are demanding a secondary language in addition to proprietary software (not necessarily R), but knowledge of at least two languages indicates an individual could reasonably learn R.\n\n\n\n7 Theme: Other Points and Considerations\n\nQuestions to consider include: What kind of training will people need in the future state? How should the support be arranged to enable the future state, potentially with IT and DEV involvement?\nDue to the required skillset, statistics and programming now need to work together more than ever\nStakeholders seek the benefits of R (e.g., Shiny, Rmarkdown), but often lack personnel to build and maintain these assets.\nR and Shiny tools can be utilized in more areas beyond TLF programming such as dose decision meetings, clinical trial design, administrative tasks, and long-term-focused applications.\nLegacy infrastructure (e.g., virtual machines and proprietary software) can pose challenges when implementing newer approaches like R and Shiny, making the transition difficult and cumbersome.\nAI and GPT can be a valuable tool in transitioning to R, but won’t completely replace a programmer. It can be used to effectively explain or translate existing code or generate entirely new code.",
