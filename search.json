    "text": "2.1.1 Summary: Transitioning from SAS to R in the Pharmaceutical Industry\nOver the past two years, there has been a significant shift in the pharmaceutical industry from SAS to R, driven by the rising costs of SAS licenses and the influx of new talent trained in R and other open-source tools. Despite these trends, the industry’s conservative nature, particularly in a highly regulated environment, often results in a reluctance to change well-established practices.\nAs of 2024, this transition is well underway, with several companies already setting timelines for a complete migration to R. This includes replicating legacy SAS code in R for ongoing and long-term studies, as well as opting not to renew SAS licenses. While some SAS programmers find the transition to R more intuitive, others may face significant challenges.\n\n\n2.1.2 Supporting SAS Programmers in Transitioning to R\nTo facilitate the learning process for SAS programmers, various strategies can be employed:\n\nTraditional Training and Mentorship: Programs such as Posit Academy and mentoring from experienced R programmers are essential. Large organizations often establish Centers of Excellence, where a designated “R floating buddy” mentors SAS programmers throughout the various stages of learning R. This mentorship should be conducted with patience and empathy, recognizing the challenges of adapting to a new programming language with different principles and syntax.\nStrategic Learning Approaches:\n\nAddress Key Pain Points: Focus on demonstrating how specific challenges are effectively resolved with R, highlighting the value of the R-based solution, and celebrating small wins to foster continued learning.\nSimplify the Learning Ecosystem: Introduce a simple set of R packages, such as the tidyverse, before gradually introducing more advanced concepts. Avoid overwhelming learners with multiple equivalent approaches.\nGradual Progression: Start with basic concepts and gradually introduce more advanced topics like version control, beginning with individual contributions and progressing to collaborative work.\n\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Managing the Transition\nThe successful shift from SAS to R requires active management by senior leadership, including clear directives, timelines, and ongoing support. It is crucial to allocate time for learning while maintaining productivity on ongoing projects.\n\n\n2.1.4 Action Items\nTo support this transition, the following resources should be developed:\n\nCheat Sheets: Create reference guides with common code examples translated from SAS to R.\nCross-Tool Comparison: Develop a Comparative Analysis of Methods and Implementations in SAS, R, and Python (CAMIS) to help programmers understand the default parameters and methods used in each tool.\n\nThis transition will not happen organically; it requires deliberate management and a structured approach to ensure successful adoption of R across the industry.",

    "text": "2.2 2023 notes\nChairs: Matthew Kumar and Cassie Burns\n\n2.2.1 Question\nWhere are we on getting data analysts and data scientists that work with clinical data on board (in particular, those delivering CSRs and submission packages)? What are the challenges - what has been overcome?\n\n\n2.2.2 Who are our people?\nPrefaced both sessions by asking individuals to define the our in our people;\n\nStat Programmers\nStatisticians\nData Management\nOther CSR-deliverable oriented roles (e.g. medical and scientific writing)\nManagement, Leadership\n\nTheme: R Adoption and Challenges\n\nThe adoption of R requires varied types of commitment depending on the perspective of the stakeholders involved, notably management and employees.\nLeadership usually supports the adoption of R, yet, in many cases, they don’t adequately communicate or advocate its application. Common concerns include the lack of realized ROI and the perception of R as a “nice-to-have” rather than a necessity.\nIt is not viable to mandate or compel individuals to learn R.\nSeasoned programmers, who prefer proprietary software, may leave the company if forced to switch.\nThese programmers often prefer to maintain current workflows that involve proprietary tools, established macros, homegrown IDEs, etc.\nSome in management endorse an approach of “mandate” or “force,” while others aim to “encourage.”\nExperienced stat programmers cite R’s learning curve as an obstacle to transition, and some don’t see the ROI in making the switch.\n\nTheme: Change Management\n\nImplementing proper change management was emphasized by several attendees in both sessions.\nOrganically, through change management, approximately 25% of experienced statistical programmers or statisticians have successfully completed R training, while the remaining 75% have shown resistance.\nAmong the successful 25%, only 5% have applied what they’ve learned in actual study work. This is often due to time constraints related to product deliverables.\nMapping the transition to R with learning and development goals is one strategy.\nA structured learning plan and a roadmap for R upskilling are essential. This includes trainings focused on R, particularly in the context of the pharmaceutical industry, and from a proprietary software programmer’s perspective.\nIdentification of champions or early adopters among statistical programmers could aid in transitioning colleagues.\nSeveral companies shared their strategies for promoting community learning (e.g., bi-monthly meetings, presentations, assignments), both on a “just in time” basis and on a regular schedule.\nPointing individuals to ongoing efforts and resources, such as R in Pharma, PharmaVerse, Phuse, etc., can boost awareness and participation.\nGranting individuals protected or dedicated time to learn and fail is recommended. An analogy used was “giving them a safe sandbox to try making a castle.”\nR need not be used for all tasks immediately. A more measured approach, such as starting with creating figures and then moving to more complex tasks, like AdAM programming, could better build confidence and competence.\nEnsuring enough transition time and clear direction (“as of X date, we’ll work in R”) is crucial.\nHaving leadership advocacy is vital at the end of the day.\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Theme: Emerging Talent\n\nNewer talent is increasingly trained in open-source approaches and languages, with fewer exposed to proprietary tools.\nWith the rise of data science as a field of study, many are less interested in joining a company for routine implementation work; they identify as “data scientists” and have been trained in markedly different ways.\nThis affects talent attraction, development, and retention within a company.\nInnovation can come from new hires, justifying the need to foster their development and listen to their insights.\nThere’s a unique opportunity for co-mentorship: new hires (proficient in R, Python, etc.) and existing staff (experts in domain knowledge, clinical trials, etc.): how vs what/why\nThere’s a need for clear “career pathing” or “trajectories” within statistical programming as roles evolve. Examples include:\n\n “Analyst” requires traditional statistical programming knowledge and training\n“Engineer” needs DevOps skills and a systems mindset\n“Tool builder” needs a software engineering mindset\n\nGeneral trends suggest companies are demanding a secondary language in addition to proprietary software (not necessarily R), but knowledge of at least two languages indicates an individual could reasonably learn R.\n\n\n\n2.2.4 Theme: Other Points and Considerations\n\nQuestions to consider include: What kind of training will people need in the future state? How should the support be arranged to enable the future state, potentially with IT and DEV involvement?\nDue to the required skillset, statistics and programming now need to work together more than ever\nStakeholders seek the benefits of R (e.g., Shiny, Rmarkdown), but often lack personnel to build and maintain these assets.\nR and Shiny tools can be utilized in more areas beyond TLF programming such as dose decision meetings, clinical trial design, administrative tasks, and long-term-focused applications.\nLegacy infrastructure (e.g., virtual machines and proprietary software) can pose challenges when implementing newer approaches like R and Shiny, making the transition difficult and cumbersome.\nAI and GPT can be a valuable tool in transitioning to R, but won’t completely replace a programmer. It can be used to effectively explain or translate existing code or generate entirely new code.",

Is a more accurate description turnkey vs modular?\nHow to ensure our modular platform scales is an important new aspect, especially using new open source tools.\nIn a turnkey, the vendor will have baked in provenance. In a modular we must focus on making sure metadata/provenance runs as a background across the system to ensure we can trace back from an insights and transformations to the source data.\nA major pain point is how things are funded - we are not used to funding a platform for sustained evolution/innovation, but in the data science space things are constantly evolving - so moving to operations/maintenance is equilivant to decay.\n\n\n6.1.1 Relationship with informatics partners\n\nThere is often tension between informatics and the business, with the growth of business written code that looks more like software (e.g. R packages) vs the the scripts/macros we use to make.

How do you go about scaling up your application? We want to hear from other users’ experience in creating long lived R based workflows. This can be anything from small snippets of code that started off as scripts that can be sequestered into R packages that are idiomatic to commonly used R interfaces to cater to a wider audience. Shiny apps that are doing computationally heavy tasks with multiple users that require you to think about scalability, fault tolerance, and complexity.\n\n\n7.0.2 Expected impact\nSharing how others have made their R code into something that is much more user friendly or easier to contribute to. Code that readily interfaces with prior frameworks like tidyverse or scales easily. Other R users can navigate the trade-offs around consistency and scalability. Make informed decisions when writing R code taking into account future necessities such as validation requirements or maintainability.\nProductionalizing R code · rinpharma rinpharma-summit-2024 · Discussion #16\nIn the discussion, it was noted this was a common problem where an app grows into something bigger organically, and Nitesh flagged some connection to the topic of wanting to share R functions without sharing the R code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nNotes not ready yet.\n\n\n\n\n8 Resources",

    "text": "8.1.1 Objectively track migrations/language use in studies?\n\nMost companies are using Github or Gitlab for study code - if we know where all the repos are, can we scan them via the API to track things like which studies are using R, Python or still on SAS?\nKey Questions:\n\nWhat code should be scanned? Look for files present? .sas, .R, .py, .sql, etc.? Is it more accurate than inbuilt language detection present in API endpoints?\nShould the focus be on studying all code written or only focus on study code (e.g. limit scope to org that holds studies)?\nIs there an API endpoint that can indicate which repository is being used?\n\n\n\n\n8.1.2 Can we understand what packages are being used in studies?\n\nIdea:\n\nThe Posit Package Manager API doesn’t reliably say what validated R packages are used in each study, but as renv is used more, can we scan the renv.lock files to see what packages are being used?\n\nPurpose:\n\nThis helps validation teams, our teams working on R packages, as well as help flag if we need to identify who used a specific version of a specific package in a study.\nWhere packages are ‘pre-baked’ into containers to speed up ‘time to pulling data’, want to keep that as lean as possible using metrics like this.\n\n\n\n\n8.1.3 Understanding container use\n\nChallenges:\n\nHow do we understand uptake of managed images, and who is using old images?\nNeed for a strategy to manage container upgrades effectively.\nActively understand patterns of image use across your SCE\nLook at patterns that should be dealt with - e.g. large numbers of idle interactive containers clogging worker nodes\n\nIdea:\n\nPull k8’s logs to get list of all active containers by person over time\n\n\n\n\n8.1.4 Keeping Connect lean\n\nIdea:\n\nRoche had an example where &gt;500 broken items, and &gt;500 items not touched in more than a year were on the server\nUse Connect data (the postgres database as the API is very slow) to remove content\n\nPurpose:\n\nRemove potentially GBs of un-used data on the Connect server, and also enforce retention rules\n\n\n\n\n8.1.5 General notes\n\nShift continues to data being outside of the SCE\nSome companies moved to ‘iterate anywhere - final batch runs matter’ stance. Some still consider every activity requiring validation.\nDiscussion highlighted a split on whether internet access is blocked - in some companies there is no air gap, in ohers there is, particularly on ‘validated batch runs’\nsingularity compresses containers better\nbig celebrations that now we do not need to rebuild containers each time workbench is updated!!\nProvenance is an audit/validation requirement\nExplore the potential use of common tools to data engineering that are absent in clinical reporting (e.g. dbt, airflow, prefect)\n\n\n\n8.1.6 Action Items and Questions\n\nAction Item:\n\nWhite paper with Mark Bynens on the SCE.\nIn white paper, clarify what the SCE is and how to handle program environments and data integration more effectively.\n\n\n\n\n8.1.7 References\n\nJames’ posit::conf talk: epijim.uk/talk/giving-your-scientific-computing-environment-sce-a-voice\nAlanah Jonas from GSK may have a relevant talk later in the year at PHUSE EU 2024",

    "text": "Chairs: Ning Leng and Phil Bowsher\n\n10 Question\nIf we assume it’s technically possible to transfer - what would it mean to give an interactive CSR? How would primary, secondary and ad-hoc analysis be viewed? Would views change depending on role (e.g. sponsor, statistical reviewer, clinical reviewer)?\n\n\n11 Why?\nThe current process of CSR generation and review involves generating large amounts of tables and plots. In such scenarios, we believe an interactive application would provide a more efficient method to explore both primary and secondary analysis results.\n\n\n12 Barriers\n\nInternally\n\nMost companies have a highly process driven to medical writing, where any change is difficult to implement\n\nExternal / FDA\n\nConcern of encouraging data fishing, if controls on for instance subgroup analysis are not in place?\nNeed cross industry harmonization as HA is highly unlikely to accept each pharma company submitting an interactive CSR based on a different framework\n\n\n\n\n13 Requirements\n\nCan an interactive CSR by default be limited to only analyses defined in the SAP, should/can exploring a wider scope be allowed with clear and explicit intent by the app user?\n\nHow is the ROI of interactivity in a CSR impacted if it’s limited to produce only pre-specified anlayses? Would different reviewers have different access? (e.g. statisticla vs clinical)\n\nThere is a gap in patient profile modules and patient narratives in shiny apps\n\n\n\n14 Path to the CSR\nThere are many places where this tooling can be applied before the CSR:\n\nMonitoring\nDecision making - data in clinical science hands\nEfficiency boost (e.g. at unblinding app is on hand)\nCSR\n\nCan we define the tangible benefits? What is the ROI over different use cases? Could this allow health authorities to make less requests? How does this lead to faster reviews in tangible terms?\nHow would access control and security work? How would this be audited? Would this be validated? How would results be archived?\nCan commenting be possible (as you can markup a PDF/work doc)?\nExisting frameworks exist - e.g. teal from NEST. ARDs may mean additional results can be pre-generated in a controlled way - but ARDs can’t further process data.\n\n\n15 Resources\nEric Nantz, from the R Submissions working group, which have been working with the FDA on a shiny submisson as part of pilot 2:",

What are the hurdles? How can the crowd-sourced groups help?\nCould small pharma use R for IB/DSUR? Does this need to be in a validated environment?\nHow do other small pharma companies uses open-source environments? and what would be areas for collaboration?\n\n\n\n10.0.2 Expected impact\nI believe this topic would be a benefit because small pharma often needs to be innovative, but due to resource limits may rely on traditional approaches and heavily rely on CROs.

    "text": "11.1.1 Package Lifecycle Management and Validation\nLifecycle Changes and Impact: Managing the lifecycle of R packages is crucial, particularly understanding what it means for a package to change its behavior. It’s important to assess whether such changes are significant and if they impact the stability or reliability of the package. The use of tools like Diffify can help track lifecycle changes and validate whether new versions introduce breaking changes or fix bugs.\nContainerization and Stability: Containers, such as those created using Nix, are increasingly seen as a way forward for maintaining stable software environments. They help bundle specific package versions, ensuring that a validated environment can be reliably reproduced. However, there are challenges, such as what exactly gets bundled in a container and the legal implications (e.g., GPL license concerns). Posit snapshots are favored by some for controlled environments, as they significantly reduce maintenance, though migrating snapshots can introduce challenges.\nSnapshot Management: Deciding when to lock down a snapshot is crucial. Should it be at the beginning of a project, or after some initial work? Snapshots offer a stable point of reference, but as packages evolve, there’s a risk of missing out on important updates or bug fixes. The question of whether to use an old snapshot or stay on the cutting edge is a balancing act between stability and leveraging new features or fixes.\nTemporal Metrics: With rapidly changing packages, it’s important to look at temporal metrics to assess risks associated with quick changes. For instance, the validation of packages like Arrow needs to consider how a bug fix might impact its validation status and whether a high rate of change poses additional risks.\n\n\n11.1.2 Risk Management and Validation Practices\nRisk Retrospective: There’s a need for a systematic approach to retrospectively evaluate risks. For example, running old tests on new package versions can reveal breaking changes or confirm that past bugs have been addressed. This process ensures that packages remain reliable over time, even as they evolve.\nAutomation vs Human Involvement: While automation is key to maintaining consistency, especially in long-term projects, human oversight is crucial for high-risk packages. These packages often require additional validation steps, and there’s debate over how much human intervention is necessary. High-risk packages might involve more in-the-loop validation, while low-risk ones could rely more on automated processes.\n\n\n11.1.3 Internal vs External Package Validation\nDifferentiated Validation Criteria: Internal packages often have different validation criteria compared to those on CRAN. Internal developers might not be as familiar with traditional checks like R CMD checks, leading to a need for more tailored validation processes. It’s also noted that internal validation is more stringent, often requiring additional tests that aren’t open-sourced, which raises questions about whether these should be contributed to public repositories.\nBaseline and Organizational Validation: Organizations often maintain a baseline of validated packages and differentiate between internal and third-party vendor packages. Some organizations have recreated their own risk metrics tools, tailoring them to their specific needs. The audit process involves defining testing processes and being aware of the risks associated with package updates or changes.\n\n\n11.1.4 Unit Testing and Quality Assurance\nEffective Testing Beyond Coverage: Simply hitting a coverage threshold is not enough; the quality of tests is crucial. For instance, high test coverage doesn’t guarantee that the tests are meaningful or effective. There’s a need to ensure that tests validate the core functionality of packages, particularly in statistical packages that might be treated differently due to their implications in analysis.\nCustom and Public Contributions: Organizations often write additional tests on top of package tests to further validate functionality. However, these tests are usually kept internal, which leads to a discussion on the potential benefits of contributing these tests to public repositories. Barriers to this include the time-intensive nature of creating these tests and a lack of familiarity with the contribution process.\nRegulatory and Industry Standards: In regulated industries, such as pharmaceuticals, there are higher requirements for package submissions, including unit tests and documentation. Collaboration with regulatory bodies like the FDA and EMA is essential to establish minimum validation requirements. Pharmaverse, for example, has adopted a notion that all packages must have standardized documentation and testing, accepted by the community.\n\n\n11.1.5 Package Management and Environment Control\nPackage Manager and Snapshot Control: Managing package snapshots is typically the responsibility of IT, with packages being added as needed. Renv is commonly used but can sometimes fail catastrophically, leading to a preference for Posit snapshots in controlled environments. This method cuts down maintenance significantly, though issues arise when migrating snapshots, as users may have to deal with multiple package version updates simultaneously.\nContainerization Challenges: While Docker containers are technically preferred for creating stable environments, there are trade-offs, such as handling individual environments and licensing concerns. Containers might be seen as derivative works under GPL, which complicates their use in proprietary settings. Nix offers a different approach by locking down R and package versions with a declarative installation method, though challenges remain with mirrors and installation reliability. Snapshot Migration and Version Locking: The decision of when to lock down a snapshot—whether at the beginning of a project or after some work has been done—is critical. Locking down too early might prevent access to necessary updates, while delaying it could introduce instability. Some organizations favor letting certain users work on the bleeding edge to vet new package versions, while others prioritize stability by locking down environments early on.\n\n\n11.1.6 Action Items and Future Directions\nValidation Guidelines and Metrics: There’s a need to establish standard validation guidelines that include metrics to help determine risk levels. This could start with Pharmaverse and eventually be expanded to other areas in pharma and beyond.\nCollaboration with Regulatory Bodies: Working with entities like the FDA and EMA to develop minimum validation requirements and documentation standards for R packages is essential. This collaboration would help ensure that the industry adopts consistent and reliable validation practices.\nText-Based Metric Files: Creating text-based files for major defined metrics would facilitate the tracking and management of package validation. This would help in setting clear criteria for evaluating package risk and determining when additional scrutiny is needed.",

    "text": "12.2 2023\nChairs: James Black and Harvey Lieberman\n\n12.2.1 Question\nWe have a path to R package validation - but what about shiny apps? In what context would validation become relevant to shiny app code, and how can we get ahead of this topic to pave a way forward for interactive CSRs?\n\n\n12.2.2 Topics discussed\n\n12.2.2.1 Do we need to validate?\n\nTiered approach / decision tree\n\nLowest is made by study team for study team. 2nd level is risk is unsupervised use, or specific contexts - e.g. making an app for dosing or safety. 3rd would be shiny CSR.\nIs the results going directly from the app into a submission?\nDon’t validate a shiny app - validate the static functions in the R packages. CSV may not be relevant for UIs (vs static R packages)\n\n\n\n\n12.2.2.2 What are we Testing and Why?\nThere is a clear difference of opinion throughout the industry, often led by quality groups. Some companies validate shiny apps as if they were distinct pieces of software, using their internal software validation procedures. These processes are often outdated and unsuitable, requiring timestamped user-testing and screen captures.\nOther companies solely consider packages, not even validating shiny apps, but validating just the logic. The group discussed a preferred way of working – separating the logic and the UI.\nThis brings up the question – do we really need to validate shiny apps? Can we just validate the logic?\n\n\n12.2.2.3 Who Does the Testing?\nAgain, there is some difference between companies in who does the testing. Generally, the developer writes the tests but tests are performed either by the business or by the quality group.\n\n\n12.2.2.4 Use of Automation\nQuestion posed to people present around the table: Does your company’s validation system allow for automation? Answers from the table: 8 companies = yes, 2 companies = no. Another 4 companies = no (offered by consultant who works with Pharma companies). Clearly a range of capabilities across the industry.\nFrom an automation perspective, the Pharma industry is very far behind the technology industry. Technology codebases tend to be far more complex but they are also automated. Can we learn from their platforms and apply their processes to validating shiny apps? Tools such as {shinytest2} are daunting to use. Can they be made more user friendly? There have been some steps to help automate these tasks – eg {shinyvalidator} but more work is needed in this area.\nIt’s very challenging to validate a reactive graph. Automated processes have the ability to detect changes in a single pixel – is this desirable or undesirable?\n\n\n12.2.2.5 Types of Testing\nThere is a clear difference across companies in opinions as to the amount of unit testing vs UAT and end-user testing. Unit tests are easy to write but are do not demonstrate how an app works. {shinytest2} can be used for end-user testing but, as mentioned above, may be daunting to use, may not be acceptable within a quality organization and may not fit in current work practices.\nUnit tests are generally written as code is written. They are fast to write and fast to execute. End-to-end tests, however, are written once code is complete and tend to be slow to execute.\n\n\n12.2.2.6 Robust UIs?\n\nGood to have unit tests - often manual testing. Automated can easily get messed up as the code evolves.\nWe should use the git flow - e.g. protect master and disable manual deployments\nShow or download R code is perfect for reproducibility → e.g. show code button\n\nBut then need to actually run that in a prod batch run\nthis use can case skip validation as code is run as study code\n\nSome cases where you don’t want to export and run code → e.g. output used directly for decision making are coming\nHow to handle risk of UI problems if our focus is on the static code - e.g. misnamed reactive values so wrong values being shown, even if static R packages giving correct results.\nRisk based is really important - e.g. for something like dark mode breaking, we need to know what requirements are high risk (e.g. table is correct) vs low risk (e.g. dark mode button)\n\n\n\n12.2.2.7 Ideas to improve the process\n\nValidation tests as text files (ATDD/BDD from software engineering).\n\nFrame in Gherkin format plus package of fixtures\nContribute test code to public packages\nWhen companies write extra tests, make a PR to add them to the actual package test suite and get others in the community to review and comment\nExtend to more than tests – documentation, etc.\nWe need clarity around packages used in submissions.\nWould big Pharma be willing to list all packages that pass their internal risk-assessment and share? Also share why they pass/fail a risk-assessment?\nValidating shiny apps – can we share some cross-industry experience?\nQA vs validation. At what stage should I worry about validation?\n\nCan we talk to QA departments / QA senior leadership to get them to write up their thoughts / requirements? Ask “How can we make your job easier?”\n\n\nShould we include QA and more IT at next year’s summit?\n\n\n\n12.2.2.8 Actions\n\nCan we share some common high level guidance on stratifying risk in shiny shared across companies? (Pfizer has written this already internally).\nDiscuss if we should have an extension of R package whitepaper to cover shiny?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstablish a CSR working group (first talk to Shiny submissions working group to establish overlap?)",
