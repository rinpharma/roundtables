<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Rebuilding this site

### Building locally

1. Clone a copy of the repo
2. Make some edits to the `.qmd` files.
3. Navigate to the folder on your clone and run `quarto preview` to see a preview.


As the site is built on main from a gh-action, you don't need to do a 'full' render locally.


### Making a pull request

If you would like to contribute code, we follow a very simple git flow where there is a main branch,
with no develop or staging.

In order to contribute code (assumption is you do not have write access):

1. Make a fork of this repo
1. Optionally make a branch, then apply your edits and commit them
2. Push the code up to your fork, then make a pull request (PR) onto the `main` branch of this repo
3. The website is built and deployed from a gh-action, so you do not need to pre-render. If you have any new built artifacts from your changes (things created by `quarto render`), please do not commit them to the repo.
