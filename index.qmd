## {{< fa users >}} F2F Roundtables in Chicago

~60 leaders from 40+ companies met F2F in Chicago for a series of
discussions on the most pressing topics for late-stage reporting in R. 

The discussion was crowdsourced via a github discussion, and led to the 
following topics:

- [What are our goals for a modern clinical reporting workflow, on a modern SCE?](/modern-sce.html)
- [What are the risks with our increasing external business code dependencies?](/os-depends.html)
- [We have a path to R package validation - but what are we doing with shiny apps?](/validate-shiny.html)
- [What is the path to an interactive CSR?](/shiny-csr.html)
- [The case for contributing to OS](/case-os.html)
- [Where are we with our people?](/change-management.html)
- [What should we be doing to leverage advances in LLMs/AA/AI impact? (at the drug development through to developer efficiency levels)](/llms.html)
- [What are the barriers bringing imaging/genomics/digital biomarkers and the CRF closer?](/multi-modal.html)
