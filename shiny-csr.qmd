# Interactive CSR

Chairs: Ning Leng and Phil Bowsher

# Question

If we assume it's technically possible to transfer - what would it mean to give an interactive CSR? How would primary, secondary and ad-hoc analysis be viewed? Would views change depending on role (e.g. sponsor, statistical reviewer, clinical reviewer)?
